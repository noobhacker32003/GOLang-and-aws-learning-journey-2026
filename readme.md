# Go Learning Journey

I am documenting my journey learning Go (Golang).

## Why Learn Go?
*   **Performance**: Go is compiled to machine code, making it very fast.
*   **Concurrency**: Go has built-in support for concurrency (goroutines and channels), making it great for scalable applications.
*   **Simplicity**: The language is designed to be simple and readable.
*   **Strong Standard Library**: It comes with a powerful standard library.

## Learned Topics

### 1. Variables
See [variables](./First-program/variables) for examples of variable declaration and usage.

### 2. Conditional Statements & Switch
See [conditionals](./First-program/conditionals) for examples of If/Else logic and Switch statements.
